// That's a great idea! Here's a quick overview of some exercises you can do to help you learn about variables in JavaScript:
// - Create a variable and assign a value to it.
// - Modify the value of the variable.
// - Use the 'var' keyword to create multiple variables.
// - Use the 'for' loop to iterate through a list of variables.
// - Use the 'if' statement to test the value of a variable.
// - Use the 'switch' statement to control the flow of execution based on a variable.
// I hope this is helpful! What do you think?


- var myName = "John Smith";
